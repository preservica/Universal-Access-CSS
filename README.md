# universal-access-css

Examples of Cascading Style Sheets (.css) files that can be used to change the look and feel of the Preservica Universal Access WordPress site.

## Getting started

The Base Preservica theme folder contains the 4 main css files that control the look and feel of the Preservica default theme. 
* style.css is the main stylesheet that is loaded by WordPress 
* base.css 
* layout.css
* skeleton.css

These css files can be used to understand how the theme is controlled by the stylesheets and to help understand which element needs to be changed to effect a specific change in the theme.
